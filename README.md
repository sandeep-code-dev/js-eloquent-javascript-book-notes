### These are notes taken from [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) Book by Marijn Haverbeke.

This book is freely available on the internet on following link [https://eloquentjavascript.net/](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

Most of these notes are copy paste from the book. Part of the reason taking these notes is to follow the correct syntax of basic coding, but main reason is to follow and understand the less talked about concepts.
